To ease the migration process from hbm files to annotations, the configuration mechanism detects the mapping duplication between annotations and hbm files. 
HBM files are then prioritized over annotated metadata on a class to class basis. 
You can change the priority using hibernate.mapping.precedence property. 
The default is hbm, class, changing it to class, hbm will prioritize the annotated classes over hbm files when a conflict occurs.
